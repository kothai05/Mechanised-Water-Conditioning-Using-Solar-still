INTRODUCTION :
 
        A colorless, transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid that forms the seas, lakes, rivers, and rain and is the basis of the fluids of living organisms. It covers 71% of Earth's surface. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. The systematic names for water, as determined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), are water and oxidane, although water is the more commonly used term . Water is a basic necessity of man along with food and air. Fresh water resources usually available are rivers, lakes and underground water reservoirs. About 71% of the planet is covered in water, yet of all of that 96.5% of the planet's water is found in oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps and 0.001% in the air as vapor and clouds, Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater and 98.8% of that water is in ice and groundwater. Less than 1% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes and the atmosphere. The apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, than by water itself. Light in the visible electromagnetic spectrum can traverse a couple meters of pure water (or ice) without significant absorption, so that it looks transparent and colorless. Thus aquatic plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because sunlight can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.
